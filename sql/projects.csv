ClickFire Media partnered with VML to produce a 360 campaign based on a tongue-in-cheek PSA: Americans needed “BBQ Accessibility,” the goal being to raise awareness of Wendy’s unparalleled BBQ selection.</p><p>Over the course of three weeks, we integrated live-action, post-production and social engagement at our in-house studios, tapping celebrity talent (Alfonso Ribeiro, Ralph Macchio and Steve Austin) to create our parody of a public service announcement on the dire crisis facing Americans not getting enough BBQ sauce. The video was sponsored content on Facebook and got over 4 million views the first week alone. This was later blown out through social media via the hashtag #BBQ4MERICA.  A live “Tweetathon” was held in LA, hosted by Alfonso Ribero, and a Tumblr was created to drive traffic to YouTube. Responses to tweets were edited on site in real time, resulting in 9 video responses.</p><p>In total, over 26 videos and countless GIFS were produced. The goal was 1.5 million views, butowing to the strategy, the creativity and the expertise of our teams we reached 7.5 million impressions across all channels.</p>

Custom illustration, animation, and seamless integration with live action footage, brought these unique and fun 3D peanut characters to life.</p><p>To further support the campaign, the “Yippee!” interactive experience was implemented across the peanutbutter.com website, Rich Media ad units and iADs to ensure the same happy experience across all digital devices and platforms. Our highly talented team of interactive Animators and Producers at ClickFire Media and BBDO Minneapolis created over 50 unique GIFS that were launched at the click of a “Fun Button.” Animation was shot in-house, making for a lively two weeks in our studios as as our creative teams set about creating one colorful yippee moment after another to spread happiness across the universe by clicking the “Fun Button.”</p><p>A tracking counter even allowed users to see how many “Yippee!” moments were being spread in real-time across the universe. But most importantly, over 14,000,000 yippee moments were spread throughout  our universe thanks to this campaign!</p>
